# Blümchen Operating System
Operating system for radio3.network

## Introduction
This repository contains documentation and files related to the Blümchen Operating System.

The purpose of this operating system is to provide a GUI-based operating system for microcontrollers such as the ESP32. The system is based primarily on LVGL for the GUI functions and FreeRTOS for the underlying operating system kernel.

Naming for this project is based on Herz on Herz from the singer Blümchen which describes perfectly with her song the spirit of radio3.network.


## App templates
In addition to the operating system, this project defines an app template for developers to create their own app on top of the operating system. Please check the folders on this repository for details.
